# vue-twcss-inter

sadly i'm still not wealthy after doing this multiple times

steps:

1. setup a vue project
2. setup tailwind for a vue project (should be the normal CLI way or Vite way it's whatever)
3. copy paste the rsms dot me links to your index HTML file
4. copy paste tailwindcss (twcss) config
5. copy paste tailwind main.css config
